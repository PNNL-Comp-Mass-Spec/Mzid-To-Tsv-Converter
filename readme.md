# MzidToTsvConverter

A much faster (and lower memory) alternative to the MS-GF+ built-in mzid to tsv converter.

It takes in the mzid from MS-GF+ and creates a nearly identical tsv file as the MS-GF+ converter - nearly identical because the number formatting is slightly different.

It uses the PSI_Interface to read the mzid file.
